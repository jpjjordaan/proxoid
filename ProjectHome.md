Proxoid is a ProxyServer on Android.
It allow users of not rooted phones to use their phone's internet access from a computer.

**Important :**<br />
There is an option to activate on your phone.<br />
Be sure to follow instructions on [Installation page](installation.md)<br />


# How it work #

It is based on a possibility offered by Google's sdk : it is possible to forward requests from your computer to your phone. In this case, they will be forwarded to Proxoid who will transmit them to Internet and give you the answer.

# Why not thetering ? #

Thetering on Android is wonderful but, it needs to be root on the phone wich is rarely the case.
Also, by using a proxy it will be possible to filter request and replies (change headers, add caching, remove adds, ...).

# Installation #

See [this page](installation.md)

# Features #

For now, not so much :
  * proxying (of course !)
  * user-agent filtering : you can choose to let, remove or modify your browser's user agent.

To be added
  * ~~caching and ad removal to speed up browsing~~
  * ~~statistics to know how you use your data plan~~
  * ~~may be parental control ...~~
Edit: finally, I don't thing I'll have the time to add anything more. <br />
May be statistics, but I'm really not sure. <br />
