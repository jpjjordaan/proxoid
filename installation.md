# Windows problems #

Try to follow this [Google group thread](http://groups.google.com/group/proxoid/browse_thread/thread/c3f91807459e2640)

Also, if windows doesn't ask you for any driver, uninstall the currently used with USBDeview : http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html.

# Samsung Galaxy #

Two conditions are needed to make it work with Samsung Galaxy :
  1. Install, prior to the driver, the Samsung PC Suite. Without it, the driver wouldn't work.
  1. The driver need to be taken from v1.5r3 of Google's sdk. I updated proxy-adb.zip to use this one.
In case you already installed the driver without Samsung PC Suite, unistall it before. For this, you may use USBDeview : http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html

# Motorola Droid/Milestone #
