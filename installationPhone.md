## Step 1 : Install from Market ##

I suppose that it's already done.
If not, go with your phone to Market Application and search for Proxoid.<br />
When found, click on the Proxoid item and select "Install" button.<br />

The only permission needed by Proxoid is to be abble to acces Internet (Network communication).

click on "Ok" button and wait for completion.

## Step 2 : Configure your phone ##

Proxoid will communicate with your phone via USB.<br />
It will use a feature that is usally used for application Developpement.<br />
This feature **have to be enabled on your phone**.<br />
Without it, it **can't** work.<br />

Go to home by pressing "Home" button on your phone.
(Your phone's home, not Proxoid's).<br />
Press "Menu" buttn and select "Settings".<br />
Select "Application" item.<br />
Then "Developpenent" item.<br />

Be sure that "USB debugging" checkbox is checked.
